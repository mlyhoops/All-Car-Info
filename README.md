# All-Car-Info
In this project I wanted to learn more about cars as I am a big car enthusiast. I used Beautiful Soup and Python to scrape AutoEvolution.com in order to try and learn something new about cars that I didn't know before. By implementing Seaborn I was able to visualize that Fiat has the highest number of different production models. I would have never known this as Fiat is not very big in the USA and I only know a few models off the top of my head.
